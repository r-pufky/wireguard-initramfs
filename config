# Wireguard initramfs configuration.
#
# NOTE: As most systems do not encrypt /boot, private key material is exposed
#       and compromised/untrusted. Boot wireguard network should be
#       **different** & untrusted, versus the network used after booting.
#       
# Be sure to test wireguard config with a running system before setting
# options. See: https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/wireguard-tools/wg.8.en.html
#
# Restricting dropbear connections to **only** wireguard:
#   Confirm wireguard/dropbear work without restriction first.
#
#   Set dropbear listen address to only wireguard client interface address.
#   Using example configuration:
#
#   /etc/dropbear-initramfs/config
#     ...
#     DROPBEAR_OPTIONS='... -p 172.31.255.10:22 ...'
#

# Wireguard interface name.
INTERFACE=example_vpn

# CIDR wireguard interface address.
INTERFACE_ADDR=172.31.255.10/32

# Peer public key (server's public key)
PEER_PUBLIC_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# IP:PORT of the peer (server); any reachable IP/DNS.
PEER_ENDPOINT=wg.example.com:51820

# Client Private key. Specify location of file containing only the private key.
CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEYFILE=/etc/wireguard-initramfs/private_key

# Keepalives. Required to ensure connection for non-exposed ports.
PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVES=25

# CIDR IP's allowed on wireguard connection, typically the peer (server)
ALLOWED_IPS=172.31.255.254/32
