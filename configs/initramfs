# Wireguard initramfs configuration.
#
# NOTE: As most systems do not encrypt /boot, private key material is exposed
#       and compromised/untrusted. Boot wireguard network should be
#       **different** & untrusted; versus the network used after booting.
#       Always restrict ports and access on the wireguard server.
#
# Be sure to test wireguard config with a running system before setting
# options.
#
# Restricting dropbear connections to **only** wireguard:
# * Confirm wireguard/dropbear work without restriction first.
# * Set dropbear listen address to only wireguard interface (INTERFACE_ADDR_*)
#   address:
#
#   /etc/dropbear/initramfs/config
#     DROPBEAR_OPTIONS='... -p 172.31.255.10:22 ...'

# Absolute path to working wireguard adapter config for initramfs. This is
# copied to initramfs and loaded after the hardware device is initialized to
# complete wireguard configuration.
#
# PersistentKeepalive is usually required so the machine checks in with the
# wireguard endpoint while booting. If there are issues with no connectivity
# but the adapter config works fine when the system is fully booted, this is
# very likely the cause. Suggest 25 seconds:
#
#   PersistentKeepalive = 25

# Enable wg-quick for adapter management?
#
# wg is used by default and requires no additional dependencies, at the cost of
# parsing the adapter configuration with a reduced set of options.
#
# Enabling will add wg-quick and bash to the initramfs package, enabling full
# adapter configuration support at the cost of an additional 1.4M of space. See
# references for configuration file differences.
#
# Highly recommend only enabling if basic wg configuration does not meet needs.
#
# Any value enables.
